## Getting Started

### Requirements

To execute this project be sure to install node.js on its latest [version](https://nodejs.org/es)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Angelmmc/blog-app-ionic
```
2. Navigate to the project folder
```bash
cd blog-app-ionic
```
3. Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```
4. Run the app
```bash
ionic serve
```

### Usage

- To log in the app use the mail `example@hotmail.com` and the password `123456`
- Note that tapping on a blog or profile redirects to a static route because there is no proper back-end implemented.

### Compilation for Android

If you want to build the app as an APK file, be sure to meet the following requisites:

- Install Android Studio and the SDK platform according to your Android version (I used Android 15 API 35).
- On Windows, create a system variable called `ANDROID_HOME` and set it to your installation path, e.g., `C:\Users\angelmmc\AppData\Local\Android\Sdk`.
- Install the Java SDK (I used the latest release, Java SDK 21).
- Like the Android SDK, create a system variable for Java called `JAVA_HOME` with a value like `C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-21`.

Once youâ€™ve installed the previous components and ensured the app runs correctly with `ionic serve`, follow these steps:

1. Add the Android platform (you just need to do this the first time)

```bash
ionic capacitor add android
```

2. Build the app
```bash
ionic build
```

3. Sync Android with Capacitor
```bash
ionic capacitor sync android
```

4. Move to the android folder
```bash
cd android
```

5. Assemble the app using gradlew
```bash
./gradlew assembleDebug
```

After correctly executing these commands, your APK file should be located at:

`blog-app-ionic\android\app\build\outputs\apk\debug\blog_app.apk`
