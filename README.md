This repository contains an offline version of the blog mobile application developed during my internship.  
Built with the **Ionic Vue** framework, It includes all core features and works offline using simulated data, intended for demonstration purposes only.

## üöÄ Features

- Main views such as home, profile, blog, community and saved
- Options menu when opening a blog
- Dark and Light mode
- Log in/Sign up
- Responsive mobile UI
- Local data storage
- Clean and modern design with Ionic components
- Touch gestures for navigation

## üõ†Ô∏è Previous Requirements

To execute this project be sure to install node.js on its latest [version](https://nodejs.org/es)

## üì¶ Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Angelmmc/blog-app-ionic
cd blog-app-ionic

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the app
ionic serve

```

## üë®‚Äçüíª Usage

-To log in the app use the mail `example@hotmail.com` and the password `123456`
-Note that tapping on a blog or profile redirects to a static route because there is no proper back-end implemented.

## üì¶ Compilation for Android

If you want to build the app as an APK file, be sure to meet the following requisites:

- Install Android Studio and the SDK platform according to your Android version (I used Android 15 API 35).
- On Windows, create a system variable called `ANDROID_HOME` and set it to your installation path, e.g., `C:\Users\angelmmc\AppData\Local\Android\Sdk`.
- Install the Java SDK (I used the latest release, Java SDK 21).
- Like the Android SDK, create a system variable for Java called `JAVA_HOME` with a value like `C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-21`.

Once you‚Äôve installed the previous components and ensured the app runs correctly with `ionic serve`, follow these steps:

```bash
# Add the Android platform (you just need to do this the first time)
ionic capacitor add android

# Build the app
ionic build

# Sync Android with Capacitor
ionic capacitor sync android

# Move to the android folder
cd android

# Assemble the app using gradlew
./gradlew assembleDebug
```

After correctly executing these commands, your APK file should be located at:

`blog-app-ionic\android\app\build\outputs\apk\debug\blog_app.apk`
